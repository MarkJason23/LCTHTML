        <h4>Web Framework</h4>
        <p><a href="/Home.html">by Mark</a></p><br>

        <p>A <strong>framework in web development</strong> is a pre-written set of tools, libraries, and best practices that helps developers build websites, web applications, or APIs more efficiently and with less repetitive code.</p>

        <h4>Key Features of a Web Development Framework:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Provides a consistent way to organize code (folders, files, and logic).</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-built components:</strong> Comes with functions or modules to handle common tasks (e.g., routing, authentication, form validation).</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Often includes built-in protection against common threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Reduces the amount of code you need to write from scratch.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Makes it easier to grow and maintain the app over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Two Types of Web Frameworks:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Frontend frameworks</strong> (User interface / What users see)</li><br>
        
            <ul>
                <li><strong>React</strong> is a free, open-source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UIs) — especially for web applications where content changes frequently, like social media feeds, dashboards, or forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Vue.js</strong> (pronounced "view") is a progressive JavaScript framework used to build user interfaces (UIs) and single-page applications (SPAs). It’s known for being easy to learn, lightweight, and flexible.</li>
                <li><strong>Angular</strong> is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) with powerful features for both small and large-scale projects.</li>
            </ul><br>
               
            <li><strong>Backend Frameworks</strong> (used for server-side logic, database, APIs)</li><br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Express.js</strong> (for Node.js) is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is used to build server-side (backend) applications and APIs.
                <p>Express.js runs on Node.js and allows developers to handle HTTP requests (like GET, POST), manage routes, serve web pages, or build APIs. It simplifies the process of building fast and scalable web apps using JavaScript on the server.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Laravel</strong> (PHP) is a free, open-source PHP web framework designed to make building web applications easier and faster through built-in features and clean, elegant syntax.
                <p>Laravel is a backend web development framework built on top of PHP. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and includes tools to handle tasks like routing, database interaction, user authentication, and more.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Django</strong> (Python) is a free, open-source web framework written in Python. It’s used to build secure, scalable, and fast web applications by handling much of the backend work for you.
                <p>Django is a backend framework that follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. It helps developers quickly create web applications by offering built-in tools for database access, user authentication, admin panels, and more.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> (Ruby) s a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to help developers build web applications quickly and with clean, readable code.
                <p>Ruby on Rails is a backend framework that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It promotes convention over configuration, meaning Rails makes many decisions for you by default—so you can focus on building features.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
